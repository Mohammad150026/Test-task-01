what is object and its internal representaytion in java script?
loosely speaking objects in javascript may be defined as an unordered collection
of related data of primitive or reference types in the form of "key:value"pairs.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively
in the context of an object.
you can define a property by assigning it a value.for example 
lets create an object named mycar and give it properties named make 
model and year asd follows


var mycar = new Object();
mycar.make ='altroz';
mycar.model ='tata';
mycar.year ='2018';
