                                                      HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
HTTP1.1 Transfer all the request and responses in the plain text message form.
The second one is head of line blovking in which TCP connection is blocked all other
request untill the response does not recieve. all the information related to the header 
file is repeated in every request.for better understanding lets assume the situation when 
you make a request to the server for the geeksforgeeks.html page & server respond to you as a resource 
geeksforgeeks html page.


HTTP2 works on the binary framing layer instead of taxtual that converts all the messages in binary format.
It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP2 uses HPACK 
which is used to split data from header.It compresses the header. The server sends all the others files like CSS 
& JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
